# Automatic-rubik-s-cube-solver
This is the repository of my "Automatic Rubik's cube solver", which I submitted to the Student Project Contest 2018-2019 held by the department of mechano-informatics, U-Tokyo. I made several python scripts using OpenCV to scan the color state of the Rubik's cube and also EusLisp (which is being developed by the U-Tokyo's labratory JSK) scripts to move dynamixel_arms. Fortunately, I won an award from the department for this work.
